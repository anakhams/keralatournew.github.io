        Did you know that in ancient times, a sack of Indian black pepper was
        considered to be worth a man’s life? Centuries ago, merchants in Kerala
        were trading spices in exchange for gold and precious stones. In fact,
        it was the bustling spice trade that put India, especially the Malabar
        Coast, on the world map. In those days, Ernakulam was the centre of a
        historic spice route that attracted the likes of popular explorers like
        Vasco Da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral. Today, the influence of various
        civilizations such as Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jews, French
        and English are evident in the art, architecture, cuisine and
        communities of Ernakulam. Check out the places to visit in Kochi that’ll
        let you live its history.

        Captain Joseph Ethelbert Winckler, in the year 1913. The cemetery is
        only opened on the request of the visitors.
