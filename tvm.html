        Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for
        the Indian sub-continent, must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see”
        destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller
        classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to
        local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam
        to west Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the
        times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land
        who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any
        flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of
        intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco
        Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of
        history, recorded or not.
